(ns process-control.advisor
  "ProcessControlAdvisor protocol — advisors for process control
  technician operations coordination proposals. The Advisor ingests
  a request (unit ID, operation type, telemetry) and returns a proposal
  with :effect :propose. Advisors never directly write state or dispatch
  actuation (the Governor and StateGraph Actor gate that).

  Concrete implementations: `mock-advisor` (deterministic, for testing)
  and `llm-advisor` (wraps an LLM).")
